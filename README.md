Assembly Reflections:

1. The main thing noticed was how a CPU performs using registers and how assembly allows you to give instuctions to the computer on such a level that is close to the computer for understanding. It gives you more command over the maching by allowing you to give specific instructions to the registers of the CPU for processing.
2. Coding in assembly is different from Python because in assembly you have to tell the computer HOW TO DO in addition to WHAT TO DO. You have to specify which registers to transfer to. When to start when to stop. While in python, you have to just specify whaat you want to do and the compiler takes care of the rest.

Python Reflections:

1. Python is easier for doing the same project as it is close to human language as it is a high level programming language. This makes it easier for the programers to write code and also most of the terms are easy to understand and work with.
2. Python helps abstraction in a lot of ways. You do not need to specify the variable type, you do not need to specify where to store the variable, you do not need to specify the moving and calculations on the scale of a regsiter. Python provides extraction in a lot of ways, some of which were mentioned beforehand.
